## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```
SELECT c.name, COUNT(*) AS count 
    FROM states AS s 
    INNER JOIN countries AS c ON s.country_id = c.id 
    GROUP BY c.name 
    ORDER BY count DESC
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS employees_without_bosses 
    FROM employees 
    WHERE supervisor_id IS NULL;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```
 SELECT c.name,o.address, COUNT(o.address) AS count 
    FROM employees AS em 
    INNER JOIN offices AS o ON em.office_id=o.id 
    INNER JOIN countries AS c ON o.country_id=c.id 
    GROUP BY o.address,c.name 
    ORDER BY count DESC 
    LIMIT 5;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```
SELECT supervisor_id ,COUNT(supervisor_id) AS count 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY supervisor_id 
    ORDER BY count DESC 
    LIMIT 3;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS list_of_office 
    FROM offices AS o 
    INNER JOIN states AS s ON o.state_id=s.id 
    WHERE s.name='Colorado';
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```
SELECT o.name,COUNT(*) AS count 
    FROM employees AS em 
    INNER JOIN offices AS o ON em.office_id=o.id 
    GROUP BY o.name 
    ORDER BY count DESC;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```
(SELECT o.address,COUNT(office_id) AS count 
    FROM employees AS em 
    INNER JOIN offices AS o ON em.office_id=o.id 
    GROUP BY o.address 
    ORDER BY count DESC 
    LIMIT 1) 
    UNION 
(SELECT o.address,COUNT(office_id) AS count 
    FROM employees AS em 
    INNER JOIN offices AS o ON em.office_id=o.id 
    GROUP BY o.address OR
    DER BY count ASC 
    LIMIT 1);
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```
SELECT em.uuid,
    CONCAT(em.first_name,' ',em.last_name) AS full_name,
    em.email,
    em.job_title,
    o.name AS company,
    co.name AS country,
    st.name AS state,
    su.first_name AS boss_name 
FROM employees AS em 
    INNER JOIN employees AS su ON em.supervisor_id=su.id 
    INNER JOIN offices AS o ON em.office_id=o.id 
    INNER JOIN countries AS co ON o.country_id=co.id 
    INNER JOIN states AS st ON o.state_id=st.id 
    WHERE em.supervisor_id IS NOT NULL;
```
