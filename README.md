## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(*) as count FROM countries c
    INNER JOIN  states s
    ON c.id = s.country_id 
    GROUP BY c.name;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as employees_without_bosses FROM  employees 
    WHERE supervisor_id IS NULL;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.address, COUNT(*) as count FROM offices o 
    INNER JOIN employees e ON o.id = e.office_id 
    INNER JOIN countries c ON o.country_id = c.id 
    GROUP BY c.name, o.address 
    ORDER BY count desc 
    LIMIT 5;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```sql
SELECT e.supervisor_id,count(*) as count FROM employees e 
    WHERE supervisor_id IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY e.supervisor_id 
    ORDER BY count desc 
    LIMIT 3;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as list_of_office FROM offices o 
    INNER JOIN states s 
    ON s.id= o.state_id 
    WHERE s.name LIKE 'Colorado';
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```sql
SELECT o.name,COUNT(*) as count FROM offices o
    LEFT JOIN employees e
    ON o.id=e.office_id 
    GROUP BY o.name 
    ORDER BY count desc;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```sql
WITH quantify_employees_per_office AS (
    SELECT o.address, count (*) as count FROM offices o 
    INNER JOIN employees e 
    ON o.id = e.office_id 
    GROUP BY o.address )
(SELECT * FROM quantify_employees_per_office
    ORDER BY count asc
    LIMIT 1)
    UNION 
(SELECT * FROM quantify_employees_per_office
    ORDER BY count desc
    LIMIT 1);
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```sql
SELECT  e.uuid,
        CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name),
        e.email as full_name, 
        e.job_title, 
        o.name as company, 
        c.name as country , 
        s.name as state , 
        boss.first_name AS boss_name  
    FROM employees e 
    INNER JOIN offices o 
        ON e.office_id = o.id 
    INNER JOIN countries c 
        ON o.country_id = c.id 
    INNER JOIN states s 
        ON s.id = o.state_id 
    INNER JOIN employees as boss 
        ON e.id = boss.id;
```
