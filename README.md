## 🤓 Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor.

---

## 📚 Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## 📊 Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```
select c.name,count(s.name) from countries c right join states s ON c.id = s.country_id group by c.name;
```

</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```
select count(*) as employees_without_bosses from employees where supervisor_id is null;
```

<p align="center">

</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```
select c.name, t.address, t.count from (select o.country_id,address, count(o.id) from offices o inner join employees e on o.id = e.office_id group by o.id) t inner join countries c on t.country_id = c.id order by t.count desc, c.name;
```
