## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```
SELECT countries.name, COUNT(states.id)
FROM countries
INNER JOIN states ON countries.id = states.country_id
GROUP BY countries.name;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```
SELECT COUNT(employees.id) AS employees_without_bosses
FROM employees
WHERE employees.supervisor_id IS NULL;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```
SELECT c.name,
  employee_in_office.address, employee_in_office.count
FROM (
    SELECT o.country_id AS country_id,
        o.address AS address, COUNT(e.id) AS count
    FROM offices AS o
    INNER JOIN employees AS e ON e.office_id = o.id
    GROUP BY o.id
    ) AS employee_in_office
INNER JOIN countries AS c ON employee_in_office.country_id = c.id
ORDER BY employee_in_office.count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```
SELECT s.supervisor_id, COUNT(e.id) as num_emp
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN employees AS s ON e.id = s.supervisor_id
GROUP BY s.supervisor_id
ORDER BY num_emp DESC
LIMIT 3 ;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```
SELECT COUNT(offices.id)
FROM offices
INNER JOIN states ON offices.state_id = states.id
INNER JOIN countries ON offices.country_id = countries.id
WHERE countries.name = 'United States' AND states.name = 'Colorado';
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```
SELECT offices.name, COUNT(employees.id) AS count
FROM offices
INNER JOIN states ON offices.state_id = states.id
INNER JOIN employees ON offices.id = employees.office_id
GROUP BY offices.name
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```
WITH OfficeEmployee AS (
  SELECT offices.name AS name, COUNT(employees.id) AS count_emp
  FROM offices
  INNER JOIN states ON offices.state_id = states.id
  INNER JOIN employees ON offices.id = employees.office_id
  GROUP BY offices.id
)

(SELECT name, count_emp
FROM OfficeEmployee
ORDER BY count_emp
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT name, count_emp
FROM OfficeEmployee
ORDER BY count_emp DESC
LIMIT 1)
;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```
SELECT e.uuid, CONCAT(e.first_name,' ', e.last_name) AS full_name,
  e.email, e.job_title, o.name AS company, c.name AS country, s.name as state,
  b.first_name AS boss_name
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN offices AS o ON e.office_id = o.id
INNER JOIN countries AS c ON o.country_id = c.id
INNER JOIN states AS s ON o.state_id = s.id
INNER JOIN employees AS b ON e.supervisor_id = b.id ;
```
