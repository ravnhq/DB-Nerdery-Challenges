## 🤓 Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## 🛠️ Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## 📚 Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## 📊 Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```
SELECT
    c.name,
    count(s.name)
FROM
    countries c
    RIGHT JOIN states s ON c.id = s.country_id
GROUP BY
    c.name;
```

</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```
SELECT
    count(*) AS employees_without_bosses
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    supervisor_id IS NULL;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```
SELECT
    c.name,
    t.address,
    t.count
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            o.country_id,
            address,
            count(o.id)
        FROM
            offices o
            INNER JOIN employees e ON o.id = e.office_id
        GROUP BY
            o.id
    ) t
    INNER JOIN countries c ON t.country_id = c.id
ORDER BY
    t.count DESC,
    c.name;
```

<p align="center">
