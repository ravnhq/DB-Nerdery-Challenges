## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```
SELECT c.name,
	COUNT(s.name)
FROM states s
	INNER JOIN countries c ON s.country_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER(
		WHERE supervisor_id IS NULL
	) as employess_without_bosses
FROM employees 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```
SELECT c.name,
	o.address,
	COUNT(e.office_id)
FROM employees e
	INNER JOIN offices o ON e.office_id = o.id
	INNER JOIN countries c ON o.country_id = c.id
GROUP BY e.office_id,
	c.name,
	o.address
ORDER BY e.count DESC,
	c.name DESC
LIMIT 5 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```
SELECT supervisor_id,
	COUNT(supervisor_id)
FROM employees
GROUP BY supervisor_id
ORDER BY COUNT(supervisor_id) DESC
LIMIT 3 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```
SELECT COUNT(*) as list_of_office
FROM offices
WHERE state_id = (
	SELECT id
	FROM states
	WHERE name = 'Colorado'
) 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```
SELECT o.name,
	COUNT(e.office_id)
FROM employees e
	INNER JOIN offices o ON e.office_id = o.id
GROUP BY o.name
ORDER BY COUNT(e.office_id) DESC 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```
WITH OfficesRankedByEmployees AS (
	SELECT o.address,
		COUNT(e.office_id)
	FROM employees e
		INNER JOIN offices o ON e.office_id = o.id
	GROUP BY o.address
) (
	SELECT *
	FROM OfficesRankedByEmployees
	ORDER BY count DESC
	LIMIT 1
)
UNION
(
	SELECT *
	FROM OfficesRankedByEmployees
	ORDER BY count ASC
	LIMIT 1
) 
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```
SELECT e.uuid,
	e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name as fullname,
	e.email,
	e.job_title,
	o.name as company,
	c.name as country,
	s.name as state,
	ee.first_name as boss_name
FROM employees e
	INNER JOIN offices o ON o.id = e.office_id
	INNER JOIN states s ON s.id = o.state_id
	INNER JOIN countries c ON c.id = s.country_id
	INNER JOIN employees ee ON e.supervisor_id = ee.id
```
