## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```

SELECT countries.name, COUNT(countries.name) 
FROM countries 
INNER JOIN states ON countries.id = states.country_id 
GROUP BY countries.name;

```

</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```

SELECT COUNT(*) AS employees_without_bosses 
FROM employees 
WHERE supervisor_id IS NULL;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```

SELECT countries.name, offices.address, COUNT(employees.id) 
FROM offices INNER JOIN employees ON offices.id = employees.office_id 
INNER JOIN countries ON countries.id = offices.country_id 
GROUP BY countries.name, offices.address  
ORDER BY  COUNT(employees.id) DESC LIMIT 5;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```

SELECT supervisor_id, COUNT(supervisor_id) AS count
FROM employees
GROUP BY supervisor_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 3;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```

SELECT COUNT(offices.id) AS list_of_office 
FROM offices 
INNER JOIN states 
ON offices.state_id = states.id 
WHERE states.name='Colorado';

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```

SELECT offices.name, COUNT(employees.id) 
FROM offices 
INNER JOIN employees ON offices.id = employees.office_id 
GROUP BY offices.name 
ORDER BY COUNT(employees.id) DESC;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```

(SELECT o.address, COUNT(e.office_id) AS count 
FROM offices AS o 
INNER JOIN employees AS e 
ON o.id=e.office_id
GROUP BY o.address 
ORDER BY count DESC   
LIMIT 1)

UNION ALL 

(SELECT o.address, COUNT(e.office_id) AS count 
FROM offices AS o
INNER JOIN employees AS e
ON o.id=e.office_id 
GROUP BY o.address 
ORDER BY count  
LIMIT 1) ;

```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```

SELECT e.uuid, CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS full_name, e.email, e.job_title, o.name AS company, c.name AS country, s.name AS state, boss.first_name AS boos_name
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN employees AS boss on e.supervisor_id = boss.id
INNER JOIN offices AS o on o.id = e.office_id 
INNER JOIN countries AS c on o.country_id = c.id
INNER JOIN states AS s on s.id=o.state_id;

```
