## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### ERD - Diagram <br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.0
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../src/dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL querys to achieve the following results:

1. Count the total number of states in each country.

```sql
SELECT c.name, count(s.name)
  FROM countries c
INNER JOIN states s
  ON s.country_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many employees do not have supervisores.

```sql
SELECT count(*) as employees_without_bosses
  FROM employees e
WHERE e.supervisor_id IS NULL;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five offices address with the most amount of employees, order the result by country and display a column with a counter.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.address, COUNT(e.id)
  FROM countries c
INNER JOIN offices o
  ON o.country_id = c.id
INNER JOIN employees e
  ON e.office_id = o.id
GROUP BY c.name, o.address
ORDER BY COUNT(e.id) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Three supervisors with the most amount of employees they are in charge.

```sql
SELECT supervisor_id, count(supervisor_id)
  FROM employees
WHERE supervisor_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY supervisor_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. How many offices are in the state of Colorado (United States).

```sql
SELECT count(o.*) as list_of_office
  FROM offices o
INNER JOIN states s
  ON o.state_id = s.id
INNER JOIN countries c
  ON s.country_id = c.id
WHERE s.name = 'Colorado'
  AND c.name = 'United States';
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result5.png" alt="result_5"/>
</p>

6. The name of the office with its number of employees ordered in a desc.

```sql
SELECT o.name, COUNT(e.id)
  FROM offices o
INNER JOIN employees e
  ON e.office_id = o.id
GROUP BY o.name
ORDER BY COUNT(e.id) DESC;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
</p>

7. The office with more and less employees.

```sql
(
  SELECT o.address, COUNT(e.id)
    FROM offices o
  INNER JOIN employees e
    ON e.office_id = o.id
  GROUP BY o.address
  ORDER BY COUNT(e.id) ASC 
  LIMIT 1
) 
UNION
(
  SELECT o.address, COUNT(e.id)
    FROM offices o
  INNER JOIN employees e
    ON e.office_id = o.id
  GROUP BY o.address
  ORDER BY COUNT(e.id) DESC 
  LIMIT 1
)
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/results/result7.png" alt="result_7"/>
</p>

8. Show the uuid of the employee, first_name and lastname combined, email, job_title, the name of the office they belong to, the name of the country, the name of the state and the name of the boss (boss_name)

```sql
SELECT  employee.uuid,
        CONCAT(employee.first_name,' ',employee.last_name) as full_name,
        employee.email,
        employee.job_title,
        o.name as company,
        c.name as country,
        s.name as state,
        boss.first_name as boss_name
FROM employees employee
  INNER JOIN employees boss
    ON employee.supervisor_id = boss.id
  INNER JOIN offices o
    ON employee.office_id = o.id
  INNER JOIN countries c
    ON o.country_id = c.id
  INNER JOIN states s
    ON o.state_id = s.id;
```
